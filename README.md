Data Integration & Management 🗂️
Combine data from multiple sources like booking platforms, guest feedback systems, and financial records. Ensure data integrity through effective cleaning, transformation, and validation processes to maintain high-quality insights.

Performance Metrics & KPIs 📊


Track and analyze crucial metrics for better insights:


RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): Assess the overall room revenue efficiency.


DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Measure the number of rooms available for sale each day.


ADR (Average Daily Rate): Monitor the average revenue earned per room sold.


DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Track the number of rooms booked each day.


DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Measure how many room nights were actually utilized each day.


Guest Satisfaction: Analyze real-time guest feedback to enhance the overall guest experience.

Dynamic Dashboards 📈

Build engaging dashboards for different perspectives:


Executive Dashboard for a comprehensive overview of business performance, highlighting key metrics.
